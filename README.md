# MATLAB simulations
Simulations of various physical phenomena using MATLAB. This repository contains the following simulations:

1) Bouncing ball: Simulates a bouncing ball in 1D. Solves basic kinematic equation. Initial inputs - speed and coefficient of restitution.

   File: bounce.m

2) Projectile motion: Simulates projectile motion in 2D. Solves basic kinematic equation. Initial inputs - speed of launch, angle of launch, coefficient of restitution.

   File: projectile.m

3) Simple Harmonic Motion - Simulates SHM in 1D. Initial inputs - amplitude, mass and spring constant.

   File: shm.m

4) Circular motion in 3D - Simulates circular motion of a body in 3D, using the rotation matrix. Initial inputs - position vector, velocity vector of body.

5) 2 body simulation under gravity (in 3D) - 3D simulation of 2 bodies under the action of only mutual gravitational forces. Applies Newton's Laws and solves the second order differential equations. Initial inputs - masses, position vectors and velocity vectors of both the bodies. (Note: Universal Gravitational Constant G  has been scaled to get results that can be plotted).

6) 3 body simulation under gravity (in 3D) - 3D simulation motion of 3 bodies under the action of only mutual gravitational forces. Applies Newton's Laws and solves the second order differential equations. Initial inputs - masses, position vectors and velocity vectors of both the bodies.

7) Wave packet simulation - Simulates wave packets formed from superposition of two sinusoidal waves. Clearly shows the phase velocity and group velocity of the wave packet, and shows the difference between these two types. We can see the evolution of the wave packet when the group velocity is equal to/less than/greater than the phase velocity. Initial inputs - amplitude, angular frequency, angular wave number.

8) Wave packet evolution - Simulates the evolution of a wave packet as a superposition of an increasing number of sinusoidal waves with time. Initial inputs - amplitude, angular frequency, angular wave number, number of waves to be superposed.

9) Polar coordinate plot - A very short code that shows the power of polar coordinates over Cartesian coordinates in drawing complicated (and beautiful) curves.
